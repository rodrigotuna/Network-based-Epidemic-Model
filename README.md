# Network-based Epedemic Model with Reinfections

Code for implementation of the model, and experiments.

## Abstract
With the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in epidemic models. These models have proven to be crucial resources for comprehending and forecasting the spread of infectious diseases. This research introduces a unique epidemic model that combines epidemics' social and biological aspects based on a network of social relationships. In contrast to conventional models, we consider the potential for numerous infections and include dynamic aspects such as a decline in social connections due to the manifestation of symptoms. We experiment on both synthetic and real-world data and empirically investigate our model to examine how different network topologies and simulation settings affect the spread of infections. We also compare our model to the well-known SIR, SIS, and SEIR models.
